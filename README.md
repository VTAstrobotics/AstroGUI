# AstroGUI

## About

This is a collection of work-in-progress python GUI files.

## Installation and Usage

The only requirement to run is having python3 installed.

Unlike ROS packages, these files do not need to be build within the workspace using colcon. Instead, they simply need to exist anywhere within the ROS workspace.

To run the GUI, call /bin/python3 then the path. For example...
```
/bin/python3 /workspaces/PHOENIX/src/Cool_GUI_Node
```
Alternately, you can run these inside VSCode using the run button. Useful within dev containers.
